      <p>
        I am a full stack web developer with a passion for generating positive impact with innovative solutions. I am naturally curious and driven to chase ideas and fulfilled by solving complex issues. After spearheading a transitional housing initiative in collaboration with WoodGreen Community Services and Allied Properties REIT, I gained a deeper appreciation of the intersection of technology and community engagement and decided to pursue software development to realize my ideas for social innovation.
